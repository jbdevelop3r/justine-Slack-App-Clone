## description
> SlackApp project's main goal is to help us learn how to use and deal with extensive API integration, as well as provide us with experience working as a team using GIT and Github.

### What it should look like


### Things to take note
>**Each project is not tampered with after being completed except for the readme file as this is a way to showcase the development of the user in each project as each project is a new experience for this user. Banking + Budget app is not responsive as the Banking and Budget app needs to be done in a specific timeframe, and time was mainly used for learning React as the project was primarily for learning basic and advanced use of React.**
